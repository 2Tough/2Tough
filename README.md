- Hi, I’m @2Tough, nice to meet you!
- I’m interested in DIY, self-learning, programming and working out. To get better and learn, I try to build something everyday!
- Learning is a path that never ends. I have used Freecodecamp, The Odin Project and Scrimba to learn frontend, including React. Now doing the MOOC courses for Java, python, and data science from the university of Helsinki.
- Recently started learning a Three js also. 
- Reach me at: polaski.dev@gmail.com
