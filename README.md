- Hi, I’m @2Tough, nice to meet you!
- I’m interested in DIY, self-learning, programming and working out. To get better and learn, I try to build something everyday!
- Learning is a path that never ends. I use Freecodecamp, The Odin Project and Scrimba to learn frontend, including React. 
- Recently started learning a C++ and Java. 
- Reach me at: vainferro@gmail.com
